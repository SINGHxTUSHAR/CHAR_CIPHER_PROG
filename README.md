# CHAR_CIPHER_PROG
Cipher program to encode and decode the secret message. In this program I have only use character and spaces but it have anything like numbers, symbols and etc.

A simple and very old method of sending secret messages is the substitution cipher.
  We all have used this cipher with our friends when we were a kid.
  Basically, each letter of the alphabet gets replaced by another letter of the alphabet.
  For example, every 'a' get replaced with an 'X', and every 'b' gets replaced with a 'Z', etc.
  
  
  Write a program thats ask a user to enter a secret message.
  
  
  Encrypt this message using the substitution cipher and display the encrypted message.
  Then decryped the encrypted message back to the original message.


  We will be using 2 strings below for the subsitition.
  For example, to encrypt we can replace the character at position n in alphabet string
  with the character at position n in key string.
  
  
  To decrypt we can replace the character at position n in key
  with the character at position n in alphabet.
  
  
  Currently the cipher only substitutes letters - we could easily add digits, puncuation, and so forth.
  Also, currently the cipher always substitues a lowercase letter with an uppercase letter and vice-versa.
  
  using c++ style string and their operations and functionality.
  
  Alot of improvement can be done in this program like adding a large set of string and character, number , symbols and etc.
  I had just code the simplest and easy to understand cipher for basic functionality.
